I passed the RHCSA Exam (EX200) in July of 2024.

###### Books I used

Red Hat RHCSA 9 Cert Guide: EX200 - Sander Van Vugt
: Covers all objectives but Sander has some unique ways of accomplishing tasks.
: Example “Resetting root password” using init=/bin/bash instead of rd.break.  

<br>

RHCSA Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Certification Study Guide, Eighth Edition – Michael Jang
: Great labs but missing some details on certain objectives
: Great Online material! Docs and Exams
: An example of material not covered so well were *Containers*. There were not as many examples as Sander's book or video course.

RHCSA Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9: Training and Exam Preparation Guide (EX200), Third Edition – Asghar Ghori
: I did not use this book in my studies but looked at it after passing and wished I did!  

###### Technology for Lab

Virt Manager 
: I used virt-manager on a linux OS (RHEL 9 in this case) for my lab purposes. 
: Most study materials suggest creating two VMs for study. 
: Getting hand-ons practice was the most valuable component of my prep.  

I also had a dual monitor display but **remember, you will only be allowed to use one monitor on exam day.**

###### Study Routine
 
3 months from May to the end of July
     
     
I read and followed Sanders book from start to finish and did labs along the way. Then, I did the same with Jang's book.
      
I used Sanders Video course on [Oreilly.com](https://www.oreilly.com/)  to focus on objectives that weren’t too clear in the books. 
      
I did labs almost everyday and practiced tasks with multiple steps like LVM configuration and containers regularly. I did this because these tasks involve multiple steps and I wanted to reduce the time I spent looking through man pages.
      
I took breaks when I needed. For example, in a 1 – 2 hour study session I had like 15 two-min breaks. 

Yes, I took that many breaks, especially on days that the study material was tough to get through.       

If I did not have too much energy after work, I would do at minimum one task related to an objectives – ie a task from the labs in the book resources.

I studied mostly in the evening and right before bed because I was also working a full-time job. 

###### Actual Exam

Pick a date sooner than later. I chose July 29th and stuck to it. 
      
It forced me to study on those busier days.

During the actual exam, make sure to keep going even when you hit a bump in the road.

I remember doing a task, and halfway through, I realized I was doing it on the wrong VM.

###### Final Thoughts

This was the first practical certification exam I had ever taken and I was nervous going into it. I took this exam for my own personal interests and my success or faliure was not tied to my job, at the time or anything. There was a bit of relief in that but I made it a goal and wanted to be successful!

As cliche as it may sound, if i can do it so can you!
