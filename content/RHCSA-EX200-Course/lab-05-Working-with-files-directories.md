##### Page Under Construction

{{< youtube xxxxxxxxx >}}

##### Objective Focus
**Understand and use essential tools**
: Create and edit text files
: Create, delete, copy, and move files and directories all the time.

In RHEL, most of our time will be spent with regular files and directories. 
- Files may contain text, a script, or binary data
- Directories are containers for files and other directories (sub-directories)

:	Try using stat on a file and a directory

#### File Editing 

###### VIM is going be your best friend when it comes to working with text files!

[Vim's Official Website](https://www.vim.org/)

Vim is the text editor to use here. There is nano as a second option but i am not going to cover that one.
