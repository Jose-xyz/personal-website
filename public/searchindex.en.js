RHCSA Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Certification Study Guide, Eighth Edition – Michael Jang Great labs but missing some details on certain objectives Great Online material!

Technology for Lab Virt Manager I used virt-manager on a linux OS (RHEL 9 in this case) for my lab purposes. Most study materials suggest creating two VMs for study. Getting hand-ons practice was the most valuable component of my prep. I also had a dual monitor display but remember, you will only be allowed to use one monitor on exam day.\nStudy Routine 3 months from May to the end of July\nI read and followed Sanders book from start to finish and did labs along the way. Then, I did the same with Jang’s book.\nI used Sanders Video course on Oreilly.com to focus on objectives that weren’t too clear in the books.\nI did labs almost everyday and practiced tasks with multiple steps like LVM configuration and containers regularly. I did this because these tasks involve multiple steps and I wanted to reduce the time I spent looking through man pages.\nI took breaks when I needed. For example, in a 1 – 2 hour study session I had like 15 two-min breaks.\nYes, I took that many breaks, especially on days that the study material was tough to get through.\nIf I did not have too much energy after work, I would do at minimum one task related to an objectives – ie a task from the labs in the book resources.\nI studied mostly in the evening and right before bed because I was also working a full-time job.\nActual Exam Pick a date sooner than later. I chose July 29th and stuck to it.\nIt forced me to study on those busier days.\nDuring the actual exam, make sure to keep going even when you hit a bump in the road.\nI remember doing a task, and halfway through, I realized I was doing it on the wrong VM.\nHere are some helpful links provided by Red Hat How to navigate the exam\nGetting for the remote, bootable USB set up\nFinal Thoughts This was the first practical certification exam I had ever taken and I was nervous going into it. I took this exam for my own personal interests and my success or faliure was not tied to my job, at the time or anything. There was a bit of relief in that but I made it a goal and wanted to be successful!\nAs cliche as it may sound, if i can do it so can you!",

Let us create a new directory\n$ mkdir newdir First, we learned about $ ls in Lab 2, that will help us list out the files in the directory. [learner@server1 ~]$ ls Desktop Documents Downloads Music Pictures Public Templates Videos $ ls alone does not meet our end goal.\nFrom here we have several options\nHelp option, usually an option like $ command -h --help Not all commands have the -h, –help option but it is always worth checking Sometimes, just typing in a error with a command will bring this up Next are Man Pages, short for Manual Pages.\nUsing man pages is going to be essential to passing the EX200. These manual pages are going to be avaliable to you during the exam. To get the manual page on $ ls, we use the systax $ man “command”\n[learner@server1 ~]$ man ls This brings up the manual page for $ ls, the table below shows us how to navigate a man page. Buttons What they do Up/Down Arrow Move view of page up and down Spacebar Move down one page g/G Move to top man page/ Move to bottom of man page q exit the man page /pattern Searches forward in man page ?pattern Searches forward in man page n/N Find next/previous pattern match h help with summary of commands Lets look at some available options, below are the ones that stand out for our goal -l use a long listing format -t sort by time, newest first; see --time How to look for a command searching man pages $ man -k \"keyword\" To search man pages for keywords [learner@server1 ~]$ man -k list list: nothing appropriate. If the above happens use the following command to index the man pages on the system.\n$ mandb The /usr/share/doc directory This directory contains an extensive list of documents related to software and programs on the system. Whenever the man pages and comman line tools, be sure to search here for more supporting information\n$ ls -l /usr/share/doc Info Pages Info pages are a great resource and provide a lot of details Getting to info pages are the same as getting to man pages $ info ls Press ‘h’ to get help on info pages and how to navigate\nThat is it for Lab 4, man pages and help options should suffice for the EX200 and we will continue use them through out the rest of the course.\nTrying to remember every command and avaliable option is impossible, so learning how to be resourceful is the key to completing every task.\nI am going to include the docs availiable on Red Hats website here.\nRead them for a cross reference to the man pages and help options.\nThe most important take away is getting comfortable reaching for man pages and internal system tools before googling and reaching out to the internet. :wq",
